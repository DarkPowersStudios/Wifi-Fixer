<div><h2>Known Issues:</h2></div>

<h4>Samsung Galaxy</h4>
<br>
Wifi may become unable to turn on without the message &quot Unable To Scan For Networks &quot displaying.<br><br>
At this time wifi may become unusable.  This is a known issue with the Samsung's build of Android.<br><br>
It can be fixed either by rebooting the device or going into Settings:Privacy and doing a factory reset<br><br>
Note: You will lose all your settings if you perform a factory reset.<br><br>
<br>

<h4>Wifi Sleep Policy</h4>
<br>
On Nexus One devices and some few others, Wifi Sleep Policy appears to be ignored when the screen is off.<br><br>
This is caused by wifi power save mode, which is not compatible with some wifi access points/routers.<br><br>
There is a workaround in Advanced Options which may work for you.<br><br>
Note: The workaround may take 15-30 seconds for full network function.<br><br>
Turn on Wifi Lock and Disable Sleep before enabling the workaround, and set Wifi Sleep Policy to Never<br><br>
Cyanogen Mod 6, which is now released, has a driver fix for this issue: <br>

<h4>Network Notifications</h4>
Because Wifi Fixer intercepts Wifi scans, it causes Network Notifications in wifi settings not to function.<br><br>
Wifi Fixer has its own Network Notifications as an option in its preferences.<br><br>
<br>
<h4>Slower Reconnection</h4>
The main network check was reduced from every 5 seconds to every 10 seconds. In testing, it was found that the perceived responsiveness was nearly as high as 5 seconds, but the battery savings were substantial. 
<br>
<br>
<H4>Hidden SSIDs</H4>
Android is not able to work with wifi networks using hidden SSIDs.<br><br>
If your network is set to non-broadcast SSID, you will have to change it to broadcast.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Task Killers</h4>
Important: Wifi Fixer's service can be rendered inoperable by task managers and auto task killers.<br><br>
It is strongly recommended that you do not use Wifi Fixer with this kind of software, but if you must, add WifiFixerService and LogService to the allowed list.<br><br>
