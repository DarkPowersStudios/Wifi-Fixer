<div><h2>Known Issues:</h2></div>

<h4>Task Killers</h4>
Important: Wifi Fixer's service can be rendered inoperable by task managers and auto task killers.<br><br>
It is strongly recommended that you do not use Wifi Fixer with this kind of software, but if you must, add WifiFixerService and LogService to the allowed list.<br><br>
<br>

<h4>Samsung Galaxy</h4>
<br>
Wifi may become unable to turn on without the message &quot Unable To Scan For Networks &quot displaying.<br><br>
At this time wifi may become unusable.  This is a known issue with the Samsung's build of Android.<br><br>
It can be fixed either by rebooting the device or going into Settings:Privacy and doing a factory reset<br><br>
Note: You will lose all your settings if you perform a factory reset.<br><br>
<br>

<h4>Wifi Sleep Policy</h4>
<br>
On some devices, Wifi Sleep Policy appears to be ignored when the screen is off.<br><br>
This is caused by wifi power save mode, which is not compatible with some wifi access points/routers.<br><br>
There is a workaround labelled Nexus One Sleep Fix in Advanced Options which may help.<br><br>
Note: The workaround may take 15-30 seconds for full network function.<br><br>
Set Wifi Usability to Max Wifi before enabling the workaround, and set Wifi Sleep Policy to Never<br><br>
Cyanogen Mod 6 and above have a driver fix for this issue: <br>

<br>

<h4>Network Notifications</h4>
Because Wifi Fixer intercepts Wifi scans, it causes Network Notifications in wifi settings not to function.<br><br>
Wifi Fixer has its own Network Notifications as an option in its preferences.<br><br>
<br>

<h4>Known Networks</h4>
The new Known Networks slide-up panel may not show any networks when wifi is disabled.<br><br>
The network list cannot be queried when wifi is off.<br><br>
<br>

<h4>Other Wifi Apps</h4>
Wifi Fixer essentially takes full control of wifi, which may conflict with other apps that talk directly to the Android wifi manager.
Conflicts have been minimized, but may still exist.  
<br>
<br>
<H4>Hidden SSIDs</H4>
Android is not able to work properly with wifi networks using hidden SSIDs.<br><br>
If your network is set to non-broadcast SSID, you will have to change it to broadcast.<br><br>
