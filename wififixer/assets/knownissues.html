<h4>Task Killers</h4>
Important: Wifi Fixer's service can be rendered inoperable by task managers and auto task killers.<br><br>
It is strongly recommended that you do not use Wifi Fixer with this kind of software, but if you must, add WifiFixerService and LogService to the allowed list.<br><br>
<br>

<h4>Unable To Scan for Networks</h4>
<br>
On the original Samsung Galaxy and a few other devices, Wifi may become unable to turn on without the message &quot Unable To Scan For Networks &quot displaying.<br><br>
At this time wifi may become unusable.<br><br>
It can be fixed either by removing all your wifi network entries then rebooting the device or going into Settings:Privacy and doing a factory reset<br><br>
Note: You will lose all your settings if you perform a factory reset.<br><br>
Unfortunately, this is a temporary fix.  In order to fix the problem permanently it may be necessary to root your device and install a custom rom. 
<br>

<h4>Wifi Sleep Policy</h4>
<br>
On some devices, Wifi Sleep Policy appears to be ignored when the screen is off.<br><br>
This is caused by wifi power save mode, which is not compatible with some wifi access points/routers.<br><br>
There is a workaround labelled Nexus One Sleep Fix in Advanced Options which may help.<br><br>
Note: The workaround may take 15-30 seconds for full network function and cause a temporary disconnection when your screen goes off.<br><br>
Set Wifi Usability to Max Wifi before enabling the workaround, and set Wifi Sleep Policy to Never<br><br>
Cyanogen Mod 6 and above have a driver fix for this issue: <br>

<br>
<h4>Known Networks</h4>
The Known Networks panel may not show any networks when wifi is disabled.<br><br>
The network list cannot be loaded when wifi is off on pre-Honeycomb devices.<br><br>
<br>

<h4>Other Wifi Apps</h4>
Wifi Fixer essentially takes full control of wifi, which may conflict with other apps that talk directly to the Android wifi manager.
Conflicts have been minimized, but may still exist.  
<br>
<br>
<H4>Hidden SSIDs</H4>
Android is not able to work properly with wifi networks using hidden SSIDs.<br><br>
If your network is set to non-broadcast SSID, you will have to change it to broadcast.<br><br>
<br><br>
<H4>Why can't I use Wifi Fixer to add my network?</H4>
Only Open/WPA/WPA2 is supported at this time in Local Networks.  You can use the Android settings app to connect and then the network will appear in Wifi Fixer under Known Networks. <br><br>
