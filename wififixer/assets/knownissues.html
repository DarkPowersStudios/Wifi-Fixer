<h2><font color="white">Known Issues:</font></h2>
</div>

<h4><font color="white">Task Killers</font></h4>

<font color="white">Important: Wifi Fixer's service can be rendered
inoperable by task managers and auto task killers.<br>
<br>
It is strongly recommended that you do not use Wifi Fixer with this
kind of software, but if you must, add WifiFixerService and LogService
to the allowed list.<br>
<br>
</font>

<h4><font color="white">Too Many Networks</font></h4>

<font color="white">Important: Having too many known network entries can burn battery and slow down your phone.<br>
<br>This is an Android issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have more than 10 networks, try to remove some you don't use very often. <br>
<br>
</font>

<h4><font color="white">Unable To Scan for Networks</font></h4>

<font color="white">
On the original Samsung Galaxy and a few other devices, Wifi may become
unable to turn on without the message " Unable To Scan For Networks "
displaying.<br>
<br>
At this time wifi may become unusable.<br>
<br>
It can be fixed either by removing all your wifi network entries then
rebooting the device or going into Settings:Privacy and doing a factory
reset<br>
<br>
Note: You will lose all your settings if you perform a factory reset.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this is a temporary fix. In order to solve the problem
permanently it may be necessary to root your device and install a
custom rom. <br>
</font>
<h4><font color="white">Wifi Sleep Policy</font></h4>

<font color="white">
On some devices, Wifi Sleep Policy appears to be ignored when the
screen is off.<br>
<br>
This is caused by wifi power save mode, which is not compatible with
some wifi access points/routers.<br>
<br>
There is a workaround labelled Nexus One Sleep Fix in Advanced Options
which may help.<br>
<br>
Note: The workaround will temporarily disrupt the wifi connection when
your screen goes off.<br>
<br>
Set Wifi Usability to Max Wifi before enabling the workaround, and set
Wifi Sleep Policy to Never<br>
<br>
Cyanogen Mod 6 and above have a driver fix for this issue: <br>

<br>
</font>
<h4><font color="white">Known Networks</font></h4>

<font color="white">The Known Networks panel may not show any networks
when wifi is disabled.<br>
<br>
The network list cannot be loaded when wifi is off on pre-Honeycomb
devices.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font>
<h4><font color="white">Other Wifi Apps</font></h4>

<font color="white">Wifi Fixer may conflict with other apps that talk
directly to the Android wifi manager. &nbsp; Try disabling the service
when using conflicting apps.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
</font>
<h4><font color="white">Hidden SSIDs</font></h4>

<font color="white">Android is not able to work properly with wifi
networks using hidden SSIDs.<br>
<br>
If your network is set to non-broadcast SSID, you will have to change
it to broadcast.<br>
<br>
</font>
<h4><font color="white">Why can't I use Wifi Fixer to add my network?</font></h4>

<font color="white">Only Open/WPA/WPA2 is supported at this time in
Local Networks. You can use the Android settings app to connect and
then the network will appear in Wifi Fixer under Known Networks. <br>
