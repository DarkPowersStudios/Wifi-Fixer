<div><h2>Known Issues:</h2></div>


<h4>Wifi Sleep Policy</h4>
<br>
On Nexus One devices and some few others, Wifi Sleep Policy is ignored when the screen is off.<br><br>
This has been reported happening on every Android version, and may have to do with the specific wifi chipset.<br><br>
There is currently no workaround other than setting Wifi Performance to Max Wifi.  This may or may not work.<br><br>
<br>

<h4>Network Notifications</h4>
Because Wifi Fixer intercepts Wifi scans, it causes Network Notifications to function erratically.<br><br>
Wifi Fixer will have its own Network Notifications in a future release.<br><br>
<br>
<h4>Slower Reconnection</h4>
The main network check was reduced from every 5 seconds to every 10 seconds. In testing, it was found that the perceived responsiveness was nearly as high as 5 seconds, but the battery savings were substantial. 
<br>
<br>
<H4>Hidden SSIDs</H4>
Android is not able to work with wifi networks using hidden SSIDs.<br><br>
If your network is set to non-broadcast SSID, you will have to change it to broadcast.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Task Killers</h4>
Important: Wifi Fixer's service can be rendered inoperable by task managers and auto task killers.<br><br>
It is strongly recommended that you do not use Wifi Fixer with this kind of software, but if you must, add WifiFixerService and LogService to the allowed list.<br><br>
