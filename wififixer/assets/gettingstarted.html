Wifi Fixer was written to maintain the connection to a wifi network.<br>
Wifi Fixer keeps you connected by checking to see if the network is working every 10 seconds.
If it isn't, Wifi Fixer will attempt to repair the connection.<br>
In some cases, it can take several seconds to reconnect.<br><br>
When you are out of range of a known network, Wifi Fixer scans for one, and if it finds one, it will attempt to connect.<br>
It can take up to 20 seconds for Wifi Fixer to connect to a known network which comes into range.<br>
If it can't connect, Wifi Fixer resets Wifi, then attempts to connect again.<br><br>
In those instances where Wifi Fixer is unable to recover the connection, manually toggling Wifi should work.<br><br>
Wifi Fixer is designed to work around bugs in Wifi on Android devices, but can't work around them all of the time.<br><br>
Important: Wifi Fixer's service can be rendered inoperable by task managers and auto task killers.<br>
It is strongly recommended that you do not use Wifi Fixer with this kind of software, but if you must, add WifiFixerService and LogService to the allowed list.<br><br>

Wifi Fixer no longer requires the Wifi option Network Notifications to be unchecked to function.<br>
However, because Wifi Fixer intercepts scan results, Network Notifications will not function normally.<br><br>
Important: Android is not able to work with wifi networks using hidden SSIDs.  If your network is set to non-broadcast SSID, you will have to change it to broadcast.<br>
