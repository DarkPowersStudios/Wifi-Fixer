<div><h2>Getting Started:</h2></div>
Let's get started by describing what the app is designed to do:<br>
Wifi Fixer was written to maintain the connection to a <b>configured network</b>.
When you connect to a Wifi network, it's added to a list your device keeps stored in its settings.<br>
Wifi Fixer keeps you connected by checking to see if the network is able to pass data every 5 seconds.  If it isn't, Wifi Fixer will attempt to repair the connection.<br>
Several methods may be used.  In some cases, it can take several seconds to reconnect completely.<br><br>
When you are out of range of a configured network, Wifi Fixer scans for one, and if it finds one, it will attempt to connect<br>
In some cases, the connection may not complete, in which case Wifi Fixer resets Wifi, then attempts to connect again.<br><br>
It is important to bear in mind that this application is designed to work around bugs in Wifi on Android devices, and since it is an app, and not
part of the operating system, it cannotrecover the connection all the time.<br>
The idea of the app is to improve function significantly, which it will. 
<br>In those instances where Wifi Fixer is unable to recover the connection, manually toggling Wifi will work.<br><br>
