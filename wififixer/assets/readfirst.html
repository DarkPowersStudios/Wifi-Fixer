Wifi Fixer maintains the connection to a wifi network.<br>
<br>
<b>Important: Wifi Fixer will cause interruptions in wifi service
during repair. Wifi Fixer may also toggle wifi to reset the supplicant
to a working state</b><br>
<br>
Wifi Fixer keeps you connected by checking to see if the network is
working periodically.<br>
<br>
If the signal is bad, or if there's a connection problem, Wifi Fixer
will attempt to find a known network with a better signal.<br>
<br>
If there isn't a better network, Wifi Fixer will attempt to repair the
connection.<br>
<br>
In some cases, it can take several seconds to repair.<br>
<br>
When you are out of range of a known network, Wifi Fixer scans for one,
and if it finds one, it will attempt to connect.<br>
It can take several seconds for Wifi Fixer to connect to a known
network which comes into range.<br>
<br>
If it can't connect, Wifi Fixer resets Wifi, then attempts to connect
again.<br>
<br>
In those instances where Wifi Fixer is unable to recover the
connection,
manually toggling Wifi or using the widget in wifi toggle mode should
work.<br>
