As an Open Source project, Wifi Fixer depends on you to help make it better.<br>
Constructive feedback, ideas, and problem reports are always appreciated.<br>
When emailing the developer, please try to be specific and descriptive.<br><br>
Wifi Fixer has a logging feature which lets you send diagnostic logs directly to the developer with one tap.<br>
<br>
The log's contents are helpful in diagnosing issues you might have.<br>
<br>
By default both the logging feature and the menu items for the logging feature are disabled. <br>
<br>
To enable the send log and enable logging menu items, check "Enable Log Menu" in Wifi Fixer's Logging preferences. <br>
<br>As of 0.9.0, Wifi Fixer will now record any exceptions (Force Closes) in the log.&nbsp; <br>
If you get a force close, please enable logging and send the log with an issue report. <br>
<br>
<h5>NOTE:</h5>
Please leave logging on for at least 10 minutes. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
When you send the log, Issue reports are important.&nbsp; Please include time as well.&nbsp; <br>
(Some logs are rather large.&nbsp; It would take too long to read through to find the issue without a report.)<br><br>
