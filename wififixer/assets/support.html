As an Open Source project, Wifi Fixer depends on you to help make it better.&nbsp; <br>
Constructive feedback, ideas, and problem reports are always
appreciated.&nbsp; When emailing the developer, please try to be
specific and descriptive.<br><br>
Wifi Fixer has a logging feature which lets you send diagnostic logs
directly to the developer with one tap.&nbsp; The log's contents are
helpful in diagnosing issues you might have.<br>
Logging controls are available in Wifi Fixer's preferences as one of the categories. <br>
The log file is stored in your sdcard under
/Android/data/org.wahtod.wififixer/files/wififixer_log.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some older devices may put the file in a different location. <br>
<br>
Note: Data is only captured to the log when you enable
logging.&nbsp;&nbsp; The log's data is a recording of what wifi and
Wifi FixerService are doing, so you must leave it on to record the
intended issue and turn it off after the issue is recorded, much like a
video camera.&nbsp;&nbsp; The service must be turned on to capture data
to the log. <br>
<br>Since version 0.9.0, Wifi Fixer has recorded stack traces from crashes.&nbsp; <br>
If you get a force close,&nbsp; tap Send Log to send the stack trace to the developer. <br>
Stack traces contain no personal information of any kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h5>NOTES:</h5>Please leave logging on for a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
What happens before and after what you are trying to capture may be
useful in diagnosing the issue. <br>When
you send the log, issue reports are important.&nbsp; Please include
specific time&nbsp; the issue occurred so the developer can find it in
the log. <br><br>
