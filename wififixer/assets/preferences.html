<h4>Disable Service</h4>
When checked, the background service will be disabled.<br><br>
This allows you to run apps which may conflict with Wifi Fixer, or let you use an incompatible Wifi network.<br><br>
The main screen will show <b>Active</b> when the service is running and <b>Inactive</b> when it's disabled, to remind you.<br><br>
<br>
<h4>Set Wifi Usability</h4>
This is an easy way of setting some Advanced options.<br><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Max Wifi</b></li> 
Turns on Wifi Lock and Disable Sleep, which maximizes your connection's stability but uses the most battery.<br><br>
<li><b>Balanced</b></li> 
Turns on Wifi Lock, which provides better wifi stability with slight battery drain.<br><br>
<li><b>Max Battery</b></li>
Disables Wifi Lock and Disable Sleep, which minimizes battery use.<br><br>
</ul>
<H4>Notifications</H4>
<br>
<H5>Enable Notifications</h5>
When enabled, Wifi Fixer will use the Android Notification bar to alert you when it fixes a problem.<br><br>
<br>
<h5>Network Notifications</h5>
When enabled, Wifi Fixer will notify you of open wifi networks<br><br>
<br>
<h4>Advanced Options</h4>
Note that Set Wifi Usability changes some of these options automatically.<br><br>
<br>
<h5>Enable Log Menu</h5>
By default the Logging menu options are hidden.<br><br>
This option enables them, but does not turn logging on.<BR><br>
Note: Logging records some personal information, including time zone setting and names of configured networks.<br><br>
The log may manually be emailed to the developer.<br><br>
<br>
<h5>Enable Wifi Lock</h5>
When checked, causes wifi to hold a lock, which helps keep the connection from dropping.<br> <br>
A wifi lock will use slightly more battery. <br><br>
<br>
<h5>Disable Sleep</h5>
Normally, Wifi Fixer goes to sleep when the screen is off, to conserve battery.<br><br>
This option, when checked, keeps Wifi Fixer checking the connection even when the screen is off.<br><br>
This will use moderately more battery.<br><br>
<br>
<h5>Wifi Sleep Policy</h5>
Offers a convenient way to change Wifi Sleep Policy. Normally changed in Wifi Settings:Advanced<br><br>
<br>
<h5>Disable Supplicant Fixes</h5>
If checked, this will disable supplicant fixes.  An android 1.5 or 1.6 device may function better with this checked.<br><br>
<br>
<h5>Nexus One Sleep Fix</h5>
If checked, enables Nexus One Sleep Policy Fix.  Important: Wifi Lock and Disable Sleep must be on.  Wifi Sleep Policy must be set to never.<br><br>
Even then it may not work for you.<br><br>
<br>

<h4>Widget Behavior</h4>
By default the widget will reassociate with the wifi access point, if available.<BR><br>
If checked, the widget will reset wifi by turning it off and then on.  This may fix some problems the service cannot.<br><br>
<br>
The widget can be added to the desktop by long-pressing then selecting it from the Widgets list.<br><br>
