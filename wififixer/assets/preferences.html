<h4>Disable Service</h4>
When checked, the background service will be disabled.  This allows you to run apps which may conflict with Wifi Fixer, or disable it if you're using an incompatible Wifi network.<br>
The main screen will show <b>Active</b> when the service is running and <b>Inactive</b> when it's disabled, to remind you. 

<h4>Advanced Options</h4>
Note that Set Performance changes these automatically.</b>
<h5>Enable Wifi Lock</h5>
When checked, causes wifi to hold a lock, which helps keep the connection from dropping.  A wifi lock will use slightly more battery, though. <br>
<h5>Disable Sleep</h5>
Normally, Wifi Fixer goes to sleep when the screen is off, to conserve battery.   This option, when checked, keeps Wifi Fixer checking the connection even when the screen is off.<br>
This will use slightly more battery.<br>

<H4>Set Performance</h4>
This is an easy way of setting the Advanced options.  Max Wifi turns on Wifi Lock and Disable Sleep, which maximizes your connection's stability.<br>
Balanced turns on Wifi Lock.  Max Battery disables Wifi Lock and Disable Sleep, which minimizes battery use.</b>

<H4>Enable Notifications</h4>
When enabled, Wifi Fixer will use the Android Notification bar to alert you when it fixes a problem.</b>

<h4>Enable Log Menu</h4>
By default the Logging menu options are hidden.  This option enables them, but does not turn logging on.</b>
Note: Logging records some personal information, including time zone setting and names of configured networks.  The log may manually be emailed to the developer.<br>
