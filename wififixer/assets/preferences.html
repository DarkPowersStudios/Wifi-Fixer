<h4>Disable Service</h4>
When checked, the background service will be disabled.<br>
This allows you to run apps which may conflict with Wifi Fixer, or if you're using an incompatible Wifi network.<br>
The main screen will show <b>Active</b> when the service is running and <b>Inactive</b> when it's disabled, to remind you.<br>

<h4>Advanced Options</h4>
Note that Set Performance changes some of these options automatically.<br>
<h5>Enable Wifi Lock</h5>
When checked, causes wifi to hold a lock, which helps keep the connection from dropping.<br> 
A wifi lock will use slightly more battery. <br>
<h5>Disable Sleep</h5>
Normally, Wifi Fixer goes to sleep when the screen is off, to conserve battery.<br>
This option, when checked, keeps Wifi Fixer checking the connection even when the screen is off.<br>
This will use significantly more battery.<br>
<h5>Disable Supplicant Fixes</h5>
If checked, this will disable supplicant fixes.  An android 1.5 or 1.6 device may function better with this checked.
<br>
<br>

<H4>Set Performance</h4>
This is an easy way of setting some Advanced options.<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Max Wifi</b></li> 
Turns on Wifi Lock and Disable Sleep, which maximizes your connection's stability.<br>
<li><b>Balanced</b></li> 
Turns on Wifi Lock, which provides better wifi stability with only slight battery drain.<br>
<li><b>Max Battery</b></li>
Disables Wifi Lock and Disable Sleep, which minimizes battery use.<br>
</ul>

<H4>Enable Notifications</h4>
When enabled, Wifi Fixer will use the Android Notification bar to alert you when it fixes a problem.<br>

<h4>Enable Log Menu</h4>
By default the Logging menu options are hidden.<br>
This option enables them, but does not turn logging on.<BR>
Note: Logging records some personal information, including time zone setting and names of configured networks.<br>
The log may manually be emailed to the developer.<br>

<h4>Widget Behavior</h4>
By default the widget will reassociate with the wifi access point, if available.<BR>
If checked, the widget will toggle wifi off and then on.  This may fix some problems the service cannot.<br>
<br>
The widget can be added to the desktop by long-pressing then selecting it from the Widgets list.<br>
