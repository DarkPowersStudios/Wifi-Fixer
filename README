This project began in early 2009 as an exercise in learning java and android.
I was having wifi problems on my T-Mobile G1, so I wrote a quick and dirty little
no-Activity app to force a reassociation.   I stopped working on it while I taught
myself java working on other android projects. 

Somehow, even with my other projects, this one picked up the most steam on the 
market.    Which is funny, because every hour I put into it will eventually 
come to naught because the wifi bugs in android will get fixed..

Well, not so much to naught,  I've learned a lot. 


Experimental: 0.7.0.3 Ziggurat Vertigo
