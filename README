<Project>
Intended as a purely functional set of heuristic workarounds for Android wifi. 
It is also designed to use as few resources on the user's device as possible. 

<Developers>
Public Intents: 
/wififixer/src/org/wahtod/wififixer/IntentConstants.java

<Targets>
should run on all Android devices 1.5 to 2.3 with wifi and a touchscreen

<Why is it free?>
Because software which provides utility which should've been in the product it runs on to begin with should be free!

<Developer>
I like developing for Android.  Hope it shows.   


Experimental: 0.8.0 Naugahyde Ninja

NOTE: experimental means experimental, i.e. it might not compile, might destroy your device.  

Bleeding edge ahead, use caution!
