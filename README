<Project>
Purely functional set of heuristic workarounds for Android wifi. 
Designed to use as few resources on the user's device as possible. 

<Developers>
Public Intents: 
/wififixer/src/org/wahtod/wififixer/IntentConstants.java

<Targets>
should run on all Android devices 1.5 to 2.3 with wifi and a touchscreen

<Why is it free?>
Because software which provides utility which should've been in the product it runs on to begin with should be free!

<Developer>
I like developing for Android.  Hope it shows.   


Beta: 0.8.0 Naugahyde Ninja

NOTE: Beta is -not- release quality, there are likely bugs.
